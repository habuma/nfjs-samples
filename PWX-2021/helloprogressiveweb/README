This project includes the code created during the Introduction to
Alexa Skills and Beyond the Basics sessions from PWX2021. However,
due to the AWS outage which hindered much of the live coding during
the Beyond the Basics talk, this project doesn't represent much of
the material covered in that session. (It does include the BST tests,
though.)

This project was created as an Alexa-hosted skill which means, among
other things, that Amazon setup its own CodeCommit Git repository. It
also assigned a skill ID to it that, by the time you see this, will no
longer be valid.

Therefore, I've scrubbed all of the Git and skill ID details from this
project. If you want to try it out, you'll need to create a new skill
project for yourself and then copy the interaction model, index.js,
and package.json over your newly created skill project.
