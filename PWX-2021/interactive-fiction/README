The code I demonstrated during the interactive fiction session at
PWX 2021 was created using `alexa-sfb new` or via the SFB editor.
You can easily recreate them yourself by installing the SFB CLI and/or
editor.

Nevertheless, I've included the two projects here for your review.
Where necessary, I've scrubbed any Alexa skill ID details or other
deployment details from the projects.
