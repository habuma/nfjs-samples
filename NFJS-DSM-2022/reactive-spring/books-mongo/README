In order for this example to work, you'll need a Mongo DB available at the
default port (27017). The easiest way to do this is with Docker:

 $ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name example-mongo mongo:latest

Then, you'll need to install and use the Mongo shell to create a capped collection:

 $ mongo
 > db.createCollection("cappedDsmBooks", {capped:true,size:100000})

After the capped collection has been created, you can start the app.

Create a few books in the DB. Using HTTPie (https://httpie.io/):

 $ http :8080/books isbn=1111122222 title="Spring in Action" author="Craig Walls"
 $ http :8080/books isbn=2222233333 title="Build Talking Apps" author="Craig Walls"

Then query the books by author using `curl`:

 $ curl "localhost:8080/books?author=Craig+Walls" -H"Accept: application/stream+json"

This should list the books the match and then block waiting for more. Create more
that match using HTTPie as shown above to see the new books appear in the `curl`
response.
