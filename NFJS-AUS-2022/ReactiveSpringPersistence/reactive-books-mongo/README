During the presentation at NFJS, I had trouble getting this to work. What
should have happened is that I would be able to `curl` to the authors endpoint
with an Accept header of "application/stream+json" and then add books for the
given author in another terminal window and see those books show up in the
stream. Sadly, it didn't work and we ran out of time before I could sort it out.

The good news is that it works now. I am not sure what I was doing wrong,
because I was able to make it work with no changes whatsoever to the code. Thus,
I'm guessing that I was doing something wrong at the command line. Who knows?

Anyway, to try this out...

 - Start a MongoDB locally listening on port 27017. I am using Docker for this
   and start it with `docker run -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:latest`
 - Open the Mongo shell (`mongo`) and create a capped collection named "cappedBooks":
   `db.createCollection("cappedBooks", {capped:true,size:100000})`
 - Start the application
 - Using `curl`, add a book to "prime the pump":
   `curl localhost:8080/books -H"Content-type: application/json" -d'{"isbn":"1122334455", title="Knitting with Dog Hair", author="Kendall Crolius"}'`
 - Fetch books by Kendall Crolius as a stream (the controller has a `produces` parameter that guarantees that it will be a stream):
   `curl "localhost:8080/books/author?author=Kendall+Crolius"`
 - You should get one book back and the request should block waiting for more.
 - In another terminal window, add another book by Kendall Crolius:
   `curl localhost:8080/books -H"Content-type: application/json" -d'{"isbn":"2233445566", title="Test Book", author="Kendall Crolius"}'`
 - You should see the new book appear in the first window's stream.
 
Optionally, if you prefer to do this with HTTPie (https://httpie.io/) instead of `curl`:
 - Add a book: `http :8080/books isbn="1122334455" title="Knitting with Dog Hair" author="Kendall Crolius"`
 - Stream a list of books: `http -S `:8080/books/author?author=Kendall+Crolius"`
 - Add a 2nd book in another terminal: `http :8080/books isbn="2233445566" title="Test Book" author="Kendall Crolius"`
