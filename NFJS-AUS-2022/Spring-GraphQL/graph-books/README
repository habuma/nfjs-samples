I mentioned that it was possible to generate documentation for a GraphQL API, but
didn't mention much on how.

The quickest and easiest way to get static documentation for your GraphQL API is
through GraphiQL. In this example, run the app, point your browser at
http://localhost:8080/graphiql, then click the "Documentation Explorer" tab on the
left side. You'll be presented with API documentation right there in the GraphiQL
UI.

There are other static documentation generators for GraphQL APIs. The list at
https://nordicapis.com/graphql-documentation-generators-explorers-and-tools/ includes
many such tools. I've not tried them all, but I have tinkered with GraphDoc a little.
Give them a try and let me know which you like best.
