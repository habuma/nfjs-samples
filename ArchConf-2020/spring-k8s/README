This directory includes the simple Spring Boot application that was deployed to a Kubernetes cluster during the "Kontain Your Spring" talk at ArchConf 2020.

Note that there is virtually nothing about this simple application that is K8s-specific. It's little more than a basic Spring Boot application. And that is kind of the point: Spring Boot applications need not, and should not be aware that they are running in a Kubernetes cluster.

The application may be built into a container with the Spring Boot Maven plugin like this:

$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName={your DockerHub name}/hello-archconf

Once built, it can be pushed to your DockerHub account. Edit the k8s/deploy.yaml file, updating the image name to match the name given when building the image. Then you can deploy it to Kubernetes like this:

$ kubectl apply -f k8s/deploy.yaml

Alternatively, do not push to DockerHub at all. Instead deploy it using Skaffold:

$ skaffold run

Or in continuous deployment mode:

$ skaffold dev
