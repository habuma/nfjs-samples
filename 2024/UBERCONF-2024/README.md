UberConf 2024 Examples
===
These are the example applications that I created during my sessions at UberConf
2024. In an effort to meet my promise to have them pushed to GitHub within 24
hours of the conference conclusion, I have pushed them as-is, with no changes
or improvements since the sessions concluded. There were a few improvements that
I said I might make before pushing the code, but other priorities have kept me
from doing that, so I'm pushing the code as-is.

If you attended the sessions and would like to see any specific improvement to
these examples, then please open a GitHub issue to this repository describing
what you'd like to see. As my time frees up, I'll try to accommodate those
requests.

Thank you for attending the sessions and I hope you had as much fun with them as
I had presenting them.
