Greater Wisconsin Software Symposium 2024
===
These are the examples from Craig's sessions at the Greater Wisconsin
Software Symposium 2024.

Note: These files represent the final state of the code from those sessions,
not necessarily any in-progress state that got us there. Specifically,
with regard to the Spring Modulith example, there were several steps we
took to get to the final state which are not represented in this repository.


I also promised an explanation as to what changed to get the tracing example
to work as well as how to run Zipkin. That explanation is forthcoming and
will be in a README file in that folder once I have a chance to put it
together. Stand by.
