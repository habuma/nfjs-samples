= How to Play Burger Battle

How many players: 2-6 PLAYERS
Time to play: 15-45 MINUTES
Age range: FOR AGES 14+

== GOAL

Win the battle by being the first player to collect all of your Burger's ingredients.

== SET UP

STEP 1: Shuffle the 8 large Burger cards and deal one to each player. Each player will leave their Burger face up in front of them.
STEP 2: Shuffle the deck thoroughly and deal 5cards to each player. Each player will hold their 5 cards where only they can see them.
STEP 3: Place the remaining deck face down in the center of the table. Flip the top card over to the side; this will act as the Graveyard.
STEP 4: Should the game continue once the deck is depleted, take the Graveyard, reshuffle and repeat step 3.

== YOUR CARDS

This is an example of how your cards should look during game play. When played, all cards on the table must be placed where they are easily read by other players.

Burger cards are oversized and have a red background with the burger's name and a list of eight ingredients needed to complete the burger.

Battle cards are cards with an orange background. These are the cards you'll use during battle to either protect your burger or to hinder your opponents' progress in building their burger.

Ingredient cards are cards with a blue background. These are the ingredients you'll collect to build your burger. Some ingredients are only useful for a specific burger.

== YOUR TURN

* The player who has eaten a Burger most recently goes first.
* To start your turn, draw a card. Cards can be drawn from the deck or an ingredient can be taken from the top of the Graveyard.Once you draw a card, you will have 6cards in your hand.
* Do you have an ingredient for your Burger in your hand? If so, you can play that ingredient and draw another card. Repeat this sequence of playing an ingredient and drawing a card until you no longer have any playable ingredients. If you don't want to play any playable ingredients for strategic reasons, you can end your turn.
* To end your turn, you can discard any card in the Graveyard or you can play a Battle Card.
* At the end of your turn, you will have 5 cards in your hand.


== BATTLE CARD NOTES
* The Burgerpocalypse card is optional. If used, show no mercy! When played, all players' ingredients are destroyed, regardless of protection. (The Burger Force Field does NOT protect against Burgerpocalypse.)
* Battle Cards can only be played during your turn, unless otherwise noted on the card.
* When playing a Battle Card that removes player's ingredients, the ingredients are placed in the Graveyard with the Battle Card on top.
* Battle Cards can be discarded without having been used.
* Battle Cards that add protection only protect your Burger & ingredients from other Battle Cards; however, they are not immune to Destroy.
* Battle Cards that add ingredients, protection or any special ability will remain to the left of the affected player's Burger; all other Battle Cards go in the Graveyard after being played.
* When satisfying Battle Cards that add ingredients, place the ingredient behind the Battle Card.
* The Old Switcheroo can be played regardless of added protection, as it acts on the player's hand, not their Burger.
* Only one form of protection can be used on your Burger at a time.
