By now, you've no doubt noticed that Generative AI is making waves across many
industries. In between all of the hype and doubt, there are several use cases
for Generative AI in many software projects. Whether it be as simple as building
a live chat to help your users or using AI to analyze data and provide
recommendations, Generative AI is becoming a key piece of software architecture.

So how can you implement Generative AI in your projects? Let me introduce you to
Spring AI.

For over two decades, the Spring Framework and its immense portfolio of projects
has been making complex problems easy for Java developers. And now with the new
Spring AI project, adding Generative AI to your Spring Boot projects couldn't be
easier! Spring AI brings an AI client and templated prompting that handles all of
the ceremony necessary to communicate with common AI APIs (such as OpenAI and Azure
OpenAI). And with Spring Boot auto-configuration, you'll be able to get straight to
the point of asking questions and getting answers your application needs.
