Event-Driven Spring Workshop - December 18, 2020

Thank you for attending my workshop. This folder contains the code I created
along the way, including a now-working version of the Spring Cloud Stream
examples.

Also included are the slides from the workshop, although we really didn't
use many of them.

If you have any questions, you know how to contact me (I'm not putting it in
this file) or at least where you can look to find my contact information. I
cannot promise a quick response, but I'll try to help you out as soon as I can.
