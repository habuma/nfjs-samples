= Kontain Your Spring

This is the code from Craig's Kontain Your Spring session at Gateway Software
Symposium in St. Louis, MO, March 31, 2023.

If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions for improvement, please
create an issue in this repository and specifically reference this folder and/or
specific files herein.

During the session, I ran out of time to complete some of the topics.
Specifically, I didn't fully demonstrate the ConfigMap work I started. Nor was
I able to get to the service discovery and Ingress topics. I am deeply sorry
that I ran out of time before I ran out of content.

I anticipate expanding these examples to include those things soon, as well as
produce some video content for each topic. Watch this repository for updates to
these examples and keep an eye on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KvfQvH5XAfbA5g7sMdOww
for the videos which I hope to produce within the next few months (as time allows).
