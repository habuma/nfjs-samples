= Event Driven Spring Workshop - April 22, 2021

This folder contains the code written during the Event-Driven Spring
Workshop held on April 22, 2021. It also has the slides that preceeded
the hands-on portion of the workshop.

A few notes to those who were in attendance:

First, I was tempted to introduce Lombok after the workshop to get (if
nothing else) a good toString() method on TripBooking and Itinerary. But
I chose not to so that you should still be able to load this code into
your IDE of choice without installing the Lombok plugin.

Instead, I did add in one instance of Itinerary a toString() method that
makes use of Spring's own ToStringCreator utility to create toString()
responses. Specifically, the Itinerary in scs-trip-sink is where you'll
find that.

Which, by the way, notice that there is now an scs-trip-sink project. This
was the one last bit that we didn't get to before running into the issue we
had between scs-trip-source and scs-trip-processor. Once I sorted out that
issue, I went ahead and added the scs-trip-sink project to complete the
story.

And, speaking of that issue...I had said that maybe it was a problem with
the source project and not the processor project. Turns out I was correct.
When I added the binding configuration for the source, I accidentally was
adding it to one of the Spring Integration examples. Consequently, the
scs-trip-source project didn't have any of that configuration and was
publishing trips to a default destination different from what the processor
was trying to pull them from. I fixed that, including removing it from
the Spring Integration example, and it all works now.

If there are any further questions or you need help, my email is on the
first slide. I can't promise a quick response, but I'll definitely try to
help out if I can. Thanks for attending!
