After having some troubles with certificates during the session and because I didn't
quite get to everything I wanted to cover, I decided to not push the code from the
session and instead provide the example code from the same talk given at DevNexus 2023.

The code is quite similar to what I was doing in the session in Des Moines, so it should
align with what was presented.

Meanwhile, the certificate issue remained, even with code that I know worked back in
April. I've not yet confirmed this, but I believe that this has something to do with
Skaffold, buildpacks, and Mac M1 hardware. Something outside of my code has changed
and is causing problems. If you are not on Apple Silicon, you'll probably be fine.
