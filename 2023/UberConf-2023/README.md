# UberConf 2023

This folder contains examples from Craig's sessions at UberConf 2023.

I promised that I would get all of the code, working or not working, in by noon on Saturday, July 22nd. This set of commits and pushes achieve that. That said, there are still a few TODOs that I owe you. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I am running behind on getting those TODOs tackled, so I won't likely get them in by the noon deadline. I will try over the next few days to sort those out, though. I apologize for not getting them done by the deadline.
