= Event Driven Spring Workshop - August 16, 2021

This folder contains the code written during the Event-Driven Spring
Workshop held on August 16, 2021. It also has the slides that preceeded
the hands-on portion of the workshop.

A few notes to those who were in attendance:

We had a few misfires during the workshop, requiring me to step back and rely
on previously-created code. That was unfortunate, but the only option if we
were to avoid getting bogged down in a lengthy debugging session.

Therefore, rather than hand you code written during today's workshop, I am
simply copying in the code from the (much more successful) April workshop.
If there is anything missing or that requires further explanation, by all
means, email me and I'll help you sort it out.

If there are any further questions or you need help, my email is on the
first slide. I can't promise a quick response, but I'll definitely try to
help out if I can. Thanks for attending!
