It feels good and you keep trekking through the trees, stopping occasionally for water or a quick bite of granola. Your mind begins to clear and you feel at one with nature. At about an hour in, the vegitation around you becomes shorter and more sparse and the trail connects with a stream that runs along your left. Then you see it, a little patch of blue expanse up ahead. Your legs are pretty tired, but you quicken your pace. The blue grows as you approach. Then, all of a sudden, the lake is right in front of you, surrounded on 3 sides by rocky peaks.",
            "rest.narration": "You take a seat on a large rock at the edge of the lake and relax with some water and granola. The sun feels great and your legs thank you for the chance to rest. You look to you right and notice that the trail continues. From where you sit, you can see it traversing back and forth up the right most peak. It must be an incredible view from up there. Would you like to continue on to the peak or call it a day and head down?",

            "peak fail.narration": "About half way up, you stop to drink some water and notice that there is not much left in your bottle. You drink the last bit and wish you had brought more water with you. It's still a pretty long way up to the top and the trail is completely exposed to the sun and wind. Just looking at the rest of the trail remaining makes your throat dry. You take stock of your situation and decide that you'd better call it a day. You head back to the lake and then down to the parking lot. You are parched and sad that you didn't make it to the top but glad that you didn't risk it. You hop in your car and head out to get a burger on your way back home. The end.",
            "peak.narration": "You stop for more granola and water frequently. Good thing you brought enough water. It is a grueling climb, much harder than your thought it would be when looking up from the lake. Eventually you start to get closer to the peak and your adrenalin starts to kick in. The air is great up here. Then you take your final step and you are standing on top of the peak and can see forever in all directions. You take a moment to soak it in and take some photos. It's quiet peaceful up there. Eventually, you decide to head down. It's a long trip down and your legs are shot but it was totally worth it. Finally, you make it to the parking lots and flop into your car. You are beat and ready for a burger. What a great day! The end.",
