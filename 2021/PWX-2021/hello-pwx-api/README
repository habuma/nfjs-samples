This is a Spring Boot project that provides a simple REST API that
can be consumed by an Alexa skill (among other things). The code that
was used to demonstrate this is commented out in index.js in the
accompanying hello-front-end project.

As demonstrated in the PWX session, there are two ways you can use
this API:

 - By deploying both the Alexa skill and this API somewhere in the
   cloud so that the Alexa skill's fulfillment code can access the
   API.
 - By running both locally. For Alexa this means deploying the skill
   once (to get the interaction model out there) and then running
   `ask run --watch --debug`. For this Spring project, you can either
   run it in the IDE or by running it with the Maven build with
   `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.
