This Alexa skill project was originally created as an Alexa-hosted skill.
That means, among other things, that deployment involves doing a Git
commit/push to an Amazon-hosted Git repository.

Although I have access and rights to push this code to deployment, you
will not. Therefore, I've removed the Git details from the project. If
you want to deploy this code for yourself, perhaps the best way is to
create your own Alexa-hosted skill (using `ask new`) and then copy the
`lambda/` and `skill-package/` folders from this project over the ones
in the Alexa-hosted skill that you created. And then, deploy your skill
using `git commit` and `git push`.

Also, as I mentioned during the session, the conversations code contained
in this project has some duplications. At one time, I was using `import`
to break my project into multiple modules and then importing various
components as needed. But then recently that stopped worked for unknown
reasons. So, I copied all of the ACDL content into a single ACDL file
at `skill-package/conversations/ScheduleTripDialog.acdl` to avoid the
import issue. I left the original ACDL in place, though.

Note that I have recently been given some tips on how to make the import
work again. Once I have had a chance to try it out, and if I can get it
to work, I'll adjust this project to remove the duplication.
