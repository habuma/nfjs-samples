This directory contains the code produced in the Event Driven Spring workshop
given Dec 17, 2021.

Note that I had a few small design hiccups early on and chose to use variations
of Itinerary across the message-driven bean and Spring Integration examples.
What I should have done was have two distinct types---TripBooking and Itinerary.
I corrected this mistake in the Spring Cloud Stream example.

In order to run these, you'll need a Rabbit broker running. See the slides PDF
for the Docker command I used to run Rabbit.
