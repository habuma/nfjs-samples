Here's a curl request:

include::{snippets}/sample/curl-request.adoc[]

And here's an HTTPie request:

include::{snippets}/sample/httpie-request.adoc[]

Want to see the request itself?

include::{snippets}/sample/http-request.adoc[]

Or what about the response?

include::{snippets}/sample/http-response.adoc[]

How about the response body?

include::{snippets}/sample/response-body.adoc[]

It's a GET request, so the request body doesn't matter much. But here it is anyway:
