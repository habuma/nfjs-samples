This Alexa skill project was originally created as an Alexa-hosted skill.
That means, among other things, that deployment involves doing a Git
commit/push to an Amazon-hosted Git repository.

Although I have access and rights to push this code to deployment, you
will not. Therefore, I've removed the Git details from the project. If
you want to deploy this code for yourself, perhaps the best way is to
create your own Alexa-hosted skill (using `ask new`) and then copy the
`lambda/` and `skill-package/` folders from this project over the ones
in the Alexa-hosted skill that you created. And then, deploy your skill
using `git commit` and `git push`.
