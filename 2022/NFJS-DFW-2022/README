This folder contains sample code written during Craig's Spring talks at the
Lonestar Software Symposium Dallas in April 2022.

What you'll find here is:

 - best-boot : Miscellaneous stuff from the "Best Boot Forward" session.
 - RSocket-Examples : The RSocket examples demonstrated during the Reactive APIs session.
 - reactive-books : The Reactive Books example started during the Reactive APIs session and continued in the Reactive Persistence session.
 - reactive-books-mongo : The MongoDB example created during the Reactive Persistence session.
 - flux-error-handling : An example of using an Exception handler with a Spring WebFlux API. This was something attempted in the Reactive Persistence session, but abandoned because I couldn't get it to work. I started again in a separate project after the session and it works as I'd have expected.

Enjoy
