This directory will (eventually) contain the code written during Craig's sessions
given at Lone Star Software Symposium-Austin on Nov 5th and 6th, 2021.

The code will be placed here within 24 hours of the conclusion of the conference.

Initially, here are the first few examples:

 - boot-workshop : The streeteats example created during the Spring Boot workshop.
 - spring-k8s : The simple Hello World example used to demonstrate Spring image builds.
